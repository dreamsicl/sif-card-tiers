      <ul>
        <li>internals changed from angular constant to firebase database for quicker loading, hopefully</li>
        <li>skill level support</li>
        <li>better localstorage - quicker loading, hopefully</li>
        <li>changing song notes/seconds/perfects/score actually does something now (why didn't anyone mention that it was broken)</li>
        <li>typeable search box removed. it doesn't work with the new internals, but if there's a huge demand for it back, i'll think about working on it</li>

      Dang. Haven't worked on this in a while.
      <ul>
        <li>I was working on making Tier List v2.0 a Schoolido.lu page, but Deby and I have been busy and we both keep missing each other, so I thought I would take a day to fix up this page. It was easier than anticipated.</li>
        <li><b>TL;DR New stuff is mostly better math.</b> C- and O-score are gone. Maybe I'll get around to documenting it soon. I don't get excited talking about this stuff anymore since I don't even get excited about the game anymore, but people still use
          this page. I didn't want to develop something and never publish it.</li>
        <li><u>School Idol Skills and Center Skills are not included.</u> If I get around to it, I would account for two SIS options - Optimal SIS (stat-boosting) and Skill Enhancement (Trick/Heel/whatever the last one is).</li>
        <li><u>Card skill calculation is much more robust.</u> I won't get in depth, but <a href="https://github.com/vphong/sif-card-tiers/blob/revamp/js/app.js#L97-L156">you can check out the math for yourself</a>.</li>
        <li>I figured out the <u>song score/points to card stat equivalence rate.</u> I thought that was cool and helpful to compare cards individually.</li>
        <li>Also figured out <u>how much Perfect Locks actually contribute to score increase.</u> <a href="https://github.com/vphong/sif-card-tiers/blob/revamp/js/app.js#L126-L136">Not much unless you get tons of Greats, as expected, but it was fun.</a> </li>
      </ul>
      Uhh, I think that's it. Again, this page is open source, so please contribute if you have the time. I still don't know how I'm going to pull off automatically updating the card database.

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Revised scoring formula to convert Score Up to its equivalent in raw stat and added it back into the scoring formula. Read more
            <a href="http://dreamsicl.github.io/sif-card-tiers/#/#scoring">here</a>.</li>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>allow song parameters input for better skill calculation;
            <a href="https://dreamsicl.github.io/sif-card-tiers/#/#skill">read more here</a>
          </li>
          <li>revised scoring formula to be more reflective of the actual game, check info page.
            <ul>
              <li>Summary: the scoring formula is now more reflective of the actual stats you will see in game if you equip optimal SIS. I have taken away score_up_boost for now, but it may come back with a weight (eg
                <code>+ score_up_boost * some_weight</code>) since Score Up doesn't directy affect a card's stats but still is something to consider when choosing a card. The same goes for perfect locks (turning goods/greats into perfects).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>better Heel display</li>
          <li>allow viewing multiple skill types at once (eg. Score Up + Healer, or all 3)</li>
          <li>User Cards page may be a bit buggy for the time being</li>
