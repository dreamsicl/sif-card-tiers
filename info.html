      </li>
      <li>This website:
        <ul>
          <li>is based off of 4.0 and accounts for School Idol Skills and new Center Bonuses</li>
          <li>is more interactive, with built-in searching and filtering</li>
          <li>is semi-automated, so it will stay up to date with the
            <a href="https://schoolido.lu">schoolido.lu</a> database
          </li>
          <li>can link to your
            <a href="https://schoolido.lu">schoolido.lu</a> account and run calculations on your own deck</li>

    <h3 class="info-subtitle" id="center">Center Skill Boosts</h3>
    <p>I will go into this section assuming that you understand what Center Skills are. If not, I recommend looking at
      <a href="http://kachagain.com/llsif/urskills.php">kachagain.com's UR center skills page</a> to get the idea of them.
    </p>
    <p>In 4.0, optimal Center Skills are the on-attribute, +9% skills (<span class="text-smile">Smile Princess</span>,
      <span class="text-pure">Pure Angel</span>, and
      <span class="text-cool">Cool Empress</span>) because bond points are directly added to raw stat. No other Center Skills are considered in C- and O-Score calculation.</p>
    <p>There are two types of Secondary center skills:
      <abbr title="Muse or Aqours">main unit</abbr> (+3%) and
      <abbr title="1st year, 2nd year, or 3rd year">class year</abbr>/subunit (+6%). For each card, C-Score assumes a main unit boost and O-Score assumes a class/subunit boost.</p>

    <h3 class="info-subtitle" id="scoring">Converting Score Up To Stat</h3>
    <p>Following the
      <a href="http://decaf.kouhi.me/lovelive/index.php?title=Scoring#Calculating_the_Score">score calculation formula on the decaf.kouhi.me wiki</a>, we can convert a raw stat into the Score that shows up when you tap a note during gameplay.
    </p>
    <p>To manipulate that formula and convert Score Up (from a card's skill activating over the course of a song) into raw stat, we take:</p>
    <p>
      <code>raw_stat = input_notes * floor((card_skill_avg / input_notes) / (0.0125 * A * C * T * M * G))</code>
    </p>
    <p>We multiply by input_notes to adjust for the course of the entire song, since the original formula only considers one note at a time.</p>
    <p>The numerator,
      <code>card_skill_avg / input_notes</code> is derived from the fact that the original formula is based on one note at a time, while the Skill Average on this website is based on the entirety of the song. In other words, this is the average Score
      Up per note a skill contributes.</p>
    <p>The denominator,
      <code>(0.0125 * A * C * T * M * G)</code>, is simply the right hand side of the original formula without the Stat multiplier, and with constants figured in, where:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>A = accuracy = <code>0.88 * input_%_greats</code></li>
      <li>C = combo position = average position = <code>floor(input_notes / 2)</code></li>
      <li>T = type of note = normal note = <code>1</code></li>
      <li>M = attribute of team member the note hits = matching = <code>1.1</code></li>
      <li>G = main unit of team member based on song = matching = <code>1.1</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In final, the Score Up to Stat formula looks like
      <code>input_notes * floor((card_skill_avg / input_notes) / (0.0125 * (0.88*input_%_greats) * floor(input_notes/2) * 1 * 1.1 * 1.1)</code>. These constants may be adjusted in the future.</p>


    <h2 class="info-subtitle" id="skill">On Card Skill Quality</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Skill quality</b> is the amount of score up/perfect lock time/stamina healed a card's skill
      <mark>at skill level 1*</mark> can contribute over the course of a song.</p>
    <p>
      The
      <b>average</b> case takes into account the percent chance of activation. The
      <b>best</b> case assumes the skill activates every single chance it gets.
    </p>

    <p>For example, take a skill that can activate 20 times with a 50% chance during a song. The average case assumes it activates 10 times. The best case assumes it activates 20 times.
    </p>

    <p><code>skill_avg = floor(song.notes * song.perfects / card.skill.activation_count) * card.skill.activation_percent * card.skill.activation_value</code></p>


    <!-- <p>
            Score Up is directly added to C- and O-Score because it directly affects card strength, unlike perfect lock time and healing.
        </p> -->

    <small class="text-muted">
            <mark>* Again, keep in mind that a card's skill can be greatly improved by skill level ups.</mark>
            Card data comes from
            <a href="http://schoolido.lu">schoolido.lu</a>, which only offers information on skill level 1.
